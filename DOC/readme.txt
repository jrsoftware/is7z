7-Zip 25.00 Sources
-------------------

7-Zip is a file archiver for Windows.

License Info
------------

7-Zip is free software distributed under the GNU LGPL 
(except for unRar code). Also some  code
is licensed under the "BSD 3-clause License".
Read "License.txt" for more infomation about license.

Notes about unRAR license:

Please check main restriction from unRar license:

   2. The unRAR sources may be used in any software to handle RAR
      archives without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used
      to re-create the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary.
      Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate form or as a
      part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
      stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
      not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.

In brief it means:
1) You can compile and use compiled files under GNU LGPL rules, since 
   unRAR license almost has no restrictions for compiled files.
   You can link these compiled files to LGPL programs.
2) You can fix bugs in source code and use compiled fixed version.
3) You can not use unRAR sources to re-create the RAR compression algorithm.


LZMA SDK
--------

This package also contains some files from LZMA SDK
You can download LZMA SDK from:
  http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html
LZMA SDK is written and placed in the public domain by Igor Pavlov.


How to compile in Windows
-------------------------

To compile the sources to Windows binaries you need Visual Studio compiler and/or Windows SDK.
You can use latest Windows Studio 2017/2019/2022 to compile binaries for x86, x64, arm64 and arm platforms.
Also you can use old compilers for some platforms:
  x86   : Visual C++ 6.0 with Platform SDK
  x64   : Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK
  ia64 (itanium)  : Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK
  arm for Windows CE : Standard SDK for Windows CE 5.0

If you use MSVC6, specify also Platform SDK directories at top of directories lists:
Tools / Options / Directories
  - Include files
  - Library files

Also you need Microsoft Macro Assembler:
  - ml.exe for x86 
  - ml64.exe for x64
You can use ml.exe from Windows SDK for Windows Vista or some later versions.

There are two ways to compile 7-Zip binaries:
1) via makefile in command line.
2) via dsp file in Visual Studio.

The dsp file compiling can be used for development and debug purposes.
All final 7-Zip binaries are compiled via makefiles, that provide best
optimization options.


How to compile with makefile in Windows
---------------------------------------

Some macronames can be defined for compiling with makefile:

PLATFORM
  with possible values: x64, x86, arm64, arm, ia64

OLD_COMPILER
  for old VC compiler, like MSCV 6.0.

MY_DYNAMIC_LINK
  for dynamic linking to the run-time library (msvcrt.dll). 
  The default makefile option is static linking to the run-time library.

To compile all 7-Zip files for x64 with Visual Studio 2022,
use the following command sequence:

  cd SRC\CPP\7zip
  %comspec% /k "C:\Program Files\VS2022\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
  nmake

You can use another "vcvars*.bat" files from "VS2022\VC\Auxiliary\Build" directory
to compile for other platforms:
  vcvars64.bat
  vcvarsamd64_arm64.bat
  vcvarsamd64_x86.bat

Also you can compile single binary from directory with related project.
For example, to compile 7za.exe, use the following command sequence:
  cd SRC\CPP\7zip\Bundles\Alone\
  nmake


Compiling 7-Zip for Unix/Linux
------------------------------

There are several options to compile 7-Zip with different compilers: gcc and clang.
Also 7-Zip code contains two versions for some parts of code: in C and in Assembeler.
So if you compile the version with Assembeler code, you will get faster 7-Zip binary.

7-Zip's assembler code uses the following syntax for different platforms:

1) x86 and x86-64 (AMD64): MASM syntax. 
   Now there are 3 programs that supports MASM syntax in Linux.
'    'Asmc Macro Assembler, JWasm, and UASM. Note that JWasm now doesn't support some 
      cpu instructions used in 7-Zip.
   So you must install Asmc Macro Assembler in Linux or UASM, if you want to compile 
   fastest version of 7-Zip  x86 and x86-64:
     https://github.com/nidud/asmc
     https://github.com/Terraspace/UASM


2) arm64: GNU assembler for ARM64 with preprocessor. 
   That systax is supported by GCC and CLANG for ARM64.

There are different binaries that can be compiled from 7-Zip source.
There are 2 main files in folder for compiling:
  makefile        - that can be used for compiling Windows version of 7-Zip with nmake command
  makefile.gcc    - that can be used for compiling Linux/macOS versions of 7-Zip or Windows version 
                    with MINGW (GCC) with make command.
                   
At first you must change the current folder to folder that contains `makefile.gcc`:

  cd CPP/7zip/Bundles/Alone2

Then you can compile `makefile.gcc` with the command:

  make -j -f makefile.gcc

Also there are additional "*.mak" files in folder "CPP/7zip/" that can be used to compile 
7-Zip binaries with optimized code and optimzing options.

To compile with GCC without assembler:
  cd CPP/7zip/Bundles/Alone2
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc.mak

To compile with CLANG without assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_clang.mak

To compile 7-Zip for x86-64 with asmc assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc_x64.mak

To compile 7-Zip for arm64 with assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc_arm64.mak

To compile 7-Zip for arm64 for macOS:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_mac_arm64.mak

Also you can change some compiler options in the "mak" files:
  cmpl_gcc.mak
  var_gcc.mak
  warn_gcc.mak

makefile.gcc supports some variables that can change compile options

USE_JWASM=1
  use JWasm assembler instead of Asmc.
  Note that JWasm doesn't support AES instructions. So AES code from C version AesOpt.c 
  will be used instead of assembler code from AesOpt.asm.

If you want to use UASM for x86-64 compiling, you can change 7zip_gcc.mak, 
or send IS_X64=1 USE_ASM=1 MY_ASM="$UASM" to make command calling:
  UASM="$PWD/GccUnixR/uasm"
  cd "7zip-src/CPP/7zip/Bundles/Alone2"
  make -f makefile.gcc -j IS_X64=1 USE_ASM=1 MY_ASM="$UASM"


DISABLE_RAR=1
  removes whole RAR related code from compilation.

DISABLE_RAR_COMPRESS=1
  removes "not fully free" code of RAR decompression codecs from compilation.

RAR decompression codecs in 7-Zip code has some additional license restrictions, 
that can be treated as not fully compatible with free-software licenses.
DISABLE_RAR_COMPRESS=1 allows to exclude such "not-fully-free" RAR code from compilation.
if DISABLE_RAR_COMPRESS=1 is specified, 7-zip will not be able to decompress files 
from rar archives, but 7-zip still will be able to open rar archives to get list of 
files or to extract files that are stored without compression.
if DISABLE_RAR=1 is specified, 7-zip will not be able to work with RAR archives.



7-Zip and p7zip
===============
Now there are two different ports of 7-Zip for Linux/macOS:

1) p7zip - another port of 7-Zip for Linux, made by an independent developer.
   The latest version of p7zip now is 16.02, and that p7zip 16.02 is outdated now.
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/ 

2) 7-Zip for Linux/macOS - this package - it's new code with all changes from latest 7-Zip for Windows.

These two ports are not identical. 
Note also that some Linux specific things can be implemented better in p7zip than in new 7-Zip for Linux.




Notes:
------
7-Zip consists of COM modules (DLL files).
But 7-Zip doesn't use standard COM interfaces for creating objects.
Look at
7zip\UI\Client7z folder for example of using DLL files of 7-Zip. 
Some DLL files can use other DLL files from 7-Zip.
If you don't like it, you must use standalone version of DLL.
To compile standalone version of DLL you must include all used parts
to project and define some defs. 
For example, 7zip\Bundles\Format7z is a standalone version  of 7z.dll 
that works with 7z format. So you can use such DLL in your project 
without additional DLL files.
